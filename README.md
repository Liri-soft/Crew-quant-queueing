## Detailed Code Explanation

### 1. Call Data Analysis (`erlang_staffing.py`)

This file is the foundation of the system. Here's exactly what it does:

**Call Data Structure:**
```python
arrival_rate_urgent = {
    "Monday": [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 23, 77, 176, ...],  # 24 numbers for each hour
    "Tuesday": [4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 12, 36, 83, ...],
    # ... data for all days
}
```
- Each number represents calls received in that hour
- Data organized by day and hour
- Allows for different patterns each day

**Staff Calculations:**
1. Takes the call volume for each hour
2. Applies the Erlang C formula:
   ```
   Traffic = (Calls per hour ร Average call time) รท 60 minutes
   Staff needed = Calculate to handle traffic with 80% answered without wait
   Final staff = Staff needed รท 70% efficiency
   ```

**Key Settings:**
- Call handle time: 6.3 minutes average
- Staff efficiency: 70% (accounts for breaks, training, admin)
- Service goal: 80% of calls answered without waiting
- These can be adjusted in the code if needed

### 2. Shift Pattern Creation (`shift_optimizer.py`)

Creates and evaluates different ways to schedule staff:

**How Patterns Work:**
```
Pattern 0: [00:00-08:00] [08:00-16:00] [16:00-24:00]
Pattern 1: [01:00-09:00] [09:00-17:00] [17:00-01:00]
Pattern 2: [02:00-10:00] [10:00-18:00] [18:00-02:00]
... and so on
```

**Pattern Evaluation Process:**
1. For each pattern:
   - Looks at each shift's hours
   - Finds the busiest hour in that shift
   - Sets staff number based on busiest hour
   - Calculates total staff and hours needed

2. Compares patterns based on:
   - Total number of staff needed
   - Total working hours required
   - How well it matches call volumes

### 3. Schedule Optimization (`ideal_shift.py`)

Finds the most efficient schedule by:

1. **Daily Analysis:**
   - Tests each pattern against each day's call volumes
   - Calculates exact staff needs for each shift
   - Measures how busy staff will be
   - Records total costs and hours

2. **Weekly Analysis:**
   - Combines daily results
   - Finds patterns that work well all week
   - Balances consistency with efficiency

3. **Output Generation:**
   ```
   Pattern 3 Results:
   - Morning (03:00-11:00): 18 staff
   - Day (11:00-19:00): 85 staff
   - Night (19:00-03:00): 26 staff
   Total: 129 staff
   Efficiency: 60.5%
   ```

### 4. Report Generation (`create_excel_report.py`)

Creates a comprehensive Excel workbook with:

1. **Staffing Needs Tab:**
   - Hour-by-hour staff requirements
   - Color-coded busy periods
   - Daily totals and averages

2. **Shift Patterns Tab:**
   - All possible patterns
   - Staff needed for each
   - Efficiency ratings

3. **Best Patterns Tab:**
   - Most efficient pattern for each day
   - Staff numbers by shift
   - Cost comparisons

### 5. Call Center Simulation (`simulation.py` and `shift_simulation.py`)

There are two different approaches to call generation in the hourly and shift simulations.

#### Hourly Simulation (`simulation.py`)
This module provides hour-by-hour validation of our Erlang C staffing calculations:

1. **Simulation Architecture and Methodology:**
   - Built on SimPy, a Python discrete-event simulation framework
   - Creates a virtual call center environment with configurable parameters
   - Implements the exact number of agents calculated for each hour
   - Generates simulated calls using actual historical call volumes
   - Models complete caller journey from arrival through queue to service/abandonment
   - Uses event-driven processing to accurately represent call center dynamics

2. **Key Parameters and Configuration Options:**
   - **Average Handle Time (AHT):** 6.3 minutes (378 seconds) as the mean, but each call varies randomly
   - **Service Level Target:** Calls answered within 20 seconds (measured as percentage)
   - **Caller Patience Model:** Exponential distribution with 2-minute average (tha patience is randomly genrated on an average 2 minutes) 
   - **Call Volume:** Based on historical data for each hour/day
   - **Call Arrival Pattern:** Random arrivals distributed across the hour
   - **Variable Service Times:** Each call's duration follows an exponential distribution with AHT as the mean

3. **Detailed Simulation Process:**
   ```python
   def run_simulation(num_agents, arrival_rate_per_hour, service_time_seconds=AHT, 
                     avg_patience_seconds=AVG_PATIENCE):
   ```
   - **Input Parameters:** Number of agents, expected call volume, average service time, and average patience time
   - **Environment Setup:** Creates a SimPy environment with the specified number of agents
   - **Call Generation Process:** 
     ```python
     def call_generator(env, agents):
         # Generates random arrival times spread throughout the hour
         arrival_times = np.sort(np.random.uniform(0, SIM_DURATION, NUM_CALLS))
     ```
   - **Call Handling Process:**
     ```python
     def handle_call(env, agents):
         # Each call has randomized service time and caller patience
         variable_service_time = np.random.exponential(service_time_seconds)
         patience = np.random.exponential(avg_patience_seconds)
     ```
   - **Results Collection:** Tracks wait times, abandonment rates, and service levels for each hour

4. **Analysis and Metrics:**
   - **Volumetric Analysis:** Compares expected vs. actual calls handled
   - **Service Level Achievement:** Percentage of calls answered within target time
   - **Abandonment Analysis:** Number and percentage of callers who hang up
   - **Wait Time Statistics:** Average and maximum times callers wait
   - **Agent Utilization:** How busy agents are throughout the hour

5. **Implementation Details:**
   - Uses `numpy.random.uniform()` to generate call arrival patterns
   - Implements exponential distribution for service times and patience
   - Uses SimPy's resource management for agent allocation
   - Employs concurrent processing to handle multiple calls simultaneously
   - Properly handles boundary conditions like zero calls or insufficient agents
   - Uses SimPy's event mechanism to model caller abandonment when patience is exceeded

#### Shift-Based Simulation (`shift_simulation.py`)
This module validates entire shift patterns with continuously varying call loads:

1. **Core Functionality and Purpose:**
   - Evaluates performance of complete shift patterns (typically 8-hour shifts)
   - Models real-world conditions where agents remain fixed while call volumes vary
   - Handles inter-hour dependencies where queues from busy periods affect later hours
   - Provides end-to-end validation of our optimized staffing plan
   - Assesses service level consistency throughout complete shifts

2. **Simulation Infrastructure:**
   ```python
   def run_shift_simulation(num_agents, hourly_arrival_rates, shift_hours=8, 
                          service_time_seconds=AHT, avg_patience_seconds=AVG_PATIENCE):

   
   ```
   - hourly_arrival_rates is an array containing call volumes for each hour in the shift.
   - **Environment:** Creates a continuous SimPy environment spanning multiple hours
   - **Agents:** Fixed number throughout the shift (as in real-world operations)
   - **Call Volumes:** Variable rates for each hour within the shift
   - **Duration:** Configurable shift length (default 8 hours)
   - **Queue Management:** Continuous queue that persists between hours

3. **Call Generation System:**
   ```python
   def call_generator(env, agents):
       # For each hour in the shift
       for hour, rate in enumerate(hourly_arrival_rates):
           # Generate arrivals for this hour
           if rate > 0:
               # Generate random arrival times within this hour
               hour_arrivals = np.random.uniform(hour*3600, (hour+1)*3600, int(rate))
   ```
   - **Hour-by-Hour Processing:** Iterates through each hour in the shift
   - **Variable Call Rates:** Handles different volumes for each hour
   - **Time Conversion:** Converts hour index to simulation seconds
   - **Random Distribution:** Creates realistic call arrival patterns
   - **Call Creation:** Generates call entities that flow through the system

4. **Call Processing and Queuing Logic:**
   ```python
   def handle_call(env, agents):
       # Generate variable service and patience times
       service_time = np.random.exponential(service_time_seconds)
       patience = np.random.exponential(avg_patience_seconds)
       
       # Try to get an agent
       with agents.request() as req:
           results = yield env.timeout(patience) | req
   ```
   - results = yield env.timeout(patience) | req line is implementing a race condition between getting an agent and running out of patience.
   - **Service Time Modeling:** Realistic variation in how long calls take
   - **Patience Modeling:** Different thresholds for when callers abandon
   - **Resource Contention:** Accurate representation of queue formation
   - **Abandonment Logic:** Callers leave if their patience is exceeded
   - **Wait Time Tracking:** Records how long each caller waits

5. **Comprehensive Analysis Framework:**
   - **Shift-Level Metrics:** Performance for each complete shift
   - **Day-Level Aggregation:** Combines shifts to show daily performance
   - **Weekly Assessment:** Provides complete picture across all days
   - **Service Level Calculation:** Percentage of calls meeting target wait time
   - **Abandonment Analysis:** Patterns of when and why callers give up

6. **Example Results and Interpretation:**
   ```
   First Shift (03:00-11:00): 
   - 28 calls arrived
   - 28 calls handled successfully
   - 0 calls abandoned
   - Average wait time: 1.2 seconds
   - Service level: 97.5% answered within target time
   - This shift had 12 agents working
   ```
   This output demonstrates how the shift performed: all calls were handled with excellent service levels.

7. **Validation Methodology:**
   - Tests each day with the optimized pattern determined by `ideal_shift.py`
   - Measures performance against service level targets
   - Identifies potential problem periods where service might suffer
   - Confirms consistent performance across all days
   - Provides confidence that the staffing plan will work in practice
