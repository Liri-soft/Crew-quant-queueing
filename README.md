## Core Features

1. Analyzes call volumes for each hour of each day
2. Calculates exact staff numbers needed using proven call center math
3. Creates and compares different shift patterns
4. Finds the most cost-effective schedule
5. Provides detailed reports and visual charts

## Detailed Code Explanation

### 1. Call Data Analysis (`erlang_staffing.py`)

This file is the foundation of the system. Here's exactly what it does:

**Call Data Structure:**
```python
arrival_rate_urgent = {
    "Monday": [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 23, 77, 176, ...],  # 24 numbers for each hour
    "Tuesday": [4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 12, 36, 83, ...],
    # ... data for all days
}
```
- Each number represents calls received in that hour
- Data organized by day and hour
- Allows for different patterns each day

**Staff Calculations:**
1. Takes the call volume for each hour
2. Applies the Erlang C formula:
   ```
   Traffic = (Calls per hour ร Average call time) รท 60 minutes
   Staff needed = Calculate to handle traffic with 80% answered without wait
   Final staff = Staff needed รท 70% efficiency
   ```

**Key Settings:**
- Call handle time: 6.3 minutes average
- Staff efficiency: 70% (accounts for breaks, training, admin)
- Service goal: 80% of calls answered without waiting
- These can be adjusted in the code if needed

### 2. Shift Pattern Creation (`shift_optimizer.py`)

Creates and evaluates different ways to schedule staff:

**How Patterns Work:**
```
Pattern 0: [00:00-08:00] [08:00-16:00] [16:00-24:00]
Pattern 1: [01:00-09:00] [09:00-17:00] [17:00-01:00]
Pattern 2: [02:00-10:00] [10:00-18:00] [18:00-02:00]
... and so on
```

**Pattern Evaluation Process:**
1. For each pattern:
   - Looks at each shift's hours
   - Finds the busiest hour in that shift
   - Sets staff number based on busiest hour
   - Calculates total staff and hours needed

2. Compares patterns based on:
   - Total number of staff needed
   - Total working hours required
   - How well it matches call volumes

### 3. Schedule Optimization (`ideal_shift.py`)

Finds the most efficient schedule by:

1. **Daily Analysis:**
   - Tests each pattern against each day's call volumes
   - Calculates exact staff needs for each shift
   - Measures how busy staff will be
   - Records total costs and hours

2. **Weekly Analysis:**
   - Combines daily results
   - Finds patterns that work well all week
   - Balances consistency with efficiency

3. **Output Generation:**
   ```
   Pattern 3 Results:
   - Morning (03:00-11:00): 18 staff
   - Day (11:00-19:00): 85 staff
   - Night (19:00-03:00): 26 staff
   Total: 129 staff
   Efficiency: 60.5%
   ```

### 4. Report Generation (`create_excel_report.py`)

Creates a comprehensive Excel workbook with:

1. **Staffing Needs Tab:**
   - Hour-by-hour staff requirements
   - Color-coded busy periods
   - Daily totals and averages

2. **Shift Patterns Tab:**
   - All possible patterns
   - Staff needed for each
   - Efficiency ratings

3. **Best Patterns Tab:**
   - Most efficient pattern for each day
   - Staff numbers by shift
   - Cost comparisons

## How to Use

1. **Setup:**
   ```powershell
   # Install all required packages using requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Prepare Your Data:**
   - Open `erlang_staffing.py`
   - Update the `arrival_rate_urgent` dictionary with your call volumes
   - Adjust settings if needed (handle time, efficiency, etc.)

3. **Run the Program:**
   ```powershell
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Review Results:**
   - Check `hourly_staffing_needs.png` for visual patterns
   - Open `StaffingReport.xlsx` for detailed analysis
   - Look at terminal output for quick insights

## Output Examples

1. **Visual Output (`hourly_staffing_needs.png`):**
   - Line graph showing staff needs
   - Different color for each day
   - Easy to spot patterns and peaks

2. **Excel Report (`StaffingReport.xlsx`):**
   - Complete analysis of all options
   - Best patterns highlighted
